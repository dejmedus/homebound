## Homebound ðŸš™
#### A rideshare service that connects travellers with passengers who'd like to tag along and share trip costs.

Homebound was ~~built~~ hacked together in a weekend for [Major League Hacking's](https://mlh.io) Hackcoming 2 Hackathon. (That's a lot of *hack*)

### Stack
- React
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)

### Uses
